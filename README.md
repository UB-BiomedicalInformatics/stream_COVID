## Model and Model Development
The SEIR model and application were developed by the University at Buffalo's [Biomedical Informatics Department](http://medicine.buffalo.edu/departments/biomedical-informatics.html) with special help from [Matthew Bonner](http://sphhp.buffalo.edu/epidemiology-and-environmental-health/faculty-and-staff/faculty-directory/mrbonner.html) in the Department of Epidemiology and Environmental and Environmental Health, [Greg Wilding](http://sphhp.buffalo.edu/biostatistics/faculty-and-staff/faculty-directory/gwilding.html) in the Department of Biostatistics, and [Great Lakes Healthcare](https://www.greatlakeshealth.com) with [Peter Winkelstein](http://medicine.buffalo.edu/faculty/profile.html?ubit=pwink). 

Building off of the core application from the [CHIME model](https://github.com/CodeForPhilly/chime/), our model adds compartments for _Exposed_ and _Death_ and fine-tunes the model for Erie County and hospital specific estimates.

Documentation of parameter choices and model choices can be found in the github Wiki.  For questions, please email [Gabe Anaya](ganaya@buffalo.edu) or [Sarah Mullin](sarahmul@buffalo.edu).
